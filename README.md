# Tree Tabs VSCode

Tree Tabs is a VSCode extension which provides a Tree-based layout mananger for open tabs.

A linear-based tab layout (just a big list of tabs) becomes messy and unuseable once you have more than a few tabs open.

Often I'm working in a file which is several logical "components" deep, trying to keep the child/parent caller/callee chains straight in my head 

With tree tabs, you can easily give child/parent/sibling relationships to tabs. This makes it much easier to quickly jump between multiple open files which call/render eachother while working in complex codebases.
